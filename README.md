# 🚀 Hey there, I'm Aren! 

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a **Computer Science student** at **Sharif University of Technology**, deeply fascinated by **AI, Deep Learning, and Generative Models**. I love exploring the intersection of **mathematics and machine learning**, pushing models to their limits, and building things that (hopefully) make a difference. 

## 🌌 What I’m Up To
- 🏗 **Building** generative models, diffusion-based architectures, and deep learning applications.
- 🔍 **Researching** time series forecasting, transformers, and hybrid sequence modeling.
- 💡 **Experimenting** with new AI techniques and sharing my findings through projects.

## 🛠 My Toolbox
💻 **Tech:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn, SQL, Linux, Git  
🧠 **Fields:** Generative Models, Reinforcement Learning, Transformers, NLP  
🛠 **Fav Projects:** DDPMs vs GANs, Informer for Time Series, Hybrid RNN-Transformer  
🎯 **Mindset:** Break things, learn fast, build better.  

## ✨ Random Facts About Me
- 📜 I implemented **Transformers from scratch** just to understand every single detail.
- 📊 I once spent hours optimizing **traffic prediction with GRUs**—turns out real-world data is messy!
- 🎶 If I weren’t into AI, I’d probably be composing **music** or lost in a book.
